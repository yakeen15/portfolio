    <h1>Solving ODE using MATLAB</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="concept">
        An <strong>ODE</strong>, or an ordinary differential equation is an equation where a dependent variable and its derivatives
         with respect to an independent variable forms an equation. Ordinary differential equations 
         are applied in various field from economics to engineering. They are an integral part of learning 
         mathematics and computational science, and as such various courses are developed to study ODEs and their solution 
         methods. When studying them, usually analytical methods are covered before numerical. But in practice analytical methods are seldom used. 
         This is the case because sometimes it might not be possible to achieve an analytical solution for our particular problem, or even if it is 
         possible it doesn't generalize well to changes in the system, in which case we would have to rewrite the whole expression for the new problem.
         Thus we are more interested in numerical solutions than the analytical solutions.<br>
         <strong>MATLAB</strong> is a computer algebra and numerical computation software that is widely used for simulations and engineering tasks. 
         It can be used to solve ODEs numerically. To use, MATLAB must be installed on your computer, or a free version can be accessed from the web 
         with certain limitation. Once it's installed, one needs to learn the proper syntax to start using it for their purposes.<br>
         An ODE can usually appear in two forms: as an initial value problem or <strong>IVP</strong> or as a boundary 
         value problem or <strong>BVP</strong>. The main difference between the two is that for an IVP, the solution at a 
         single point (usually called the initial point) given, while BVP specifies the solution at at least two different points, 
         usually called the boundaries of the solution.
