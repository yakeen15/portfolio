        <h1>Fermat's primality test</h1>
        <h2>Large prime numbers</h2>
        <p>Prime numbers are of utmost importance in a field like number theory. In cryptography, there are several encryption methods that are based upon finding large prime numbers.
             But what is a large prime number? Loosely, a large number can be said to be any number that requires <strong>more than 16 binary bits</strong> in order to be represented in 
             a computer system. For example, the number \(3660438061\) is represented as \[11011010001011011101101000101101_2\]in binary, requiring 32 bits. Is this a prime number? Our 
             usual approach should be the trial division approach, which is detailed in the next segment.
        <h2>Trial division approach</h2>
        <p>The trial division method is the easiest known algorithm to check for the primality. Given a number \(n\), it basically involves checking divisibility of \(n\) for all the 
            numbers below \(\sqrt n\). If \(n\) is a composite number, there is going to exist one number \(d\leq\sqrt n\) such that \(d\) divides \(n\) (Consult back to AMTH101 or 
            AMTH302 if you cannot recall the proof). So the algrithm has a time complexity of \(O(\sqrt n)\).
