    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="concept">
        In the course AMTH205, we learn various methods to approximate definite integrals of the form \(\int_b^af(t)dt\). However, an obvious problem arises for improper integral 
        which has one or both limits reach infinity. There are special methods that could be employed to find the approximate numerical result for problems which has an infinite 
        limit. In this page, we are going to consider a particular case of such integrals, the one shown below \[\int^\infty_0e^{-x}f(x)dx\]The Laguerre polynomials taught in AMTH304 
        can help numerically approximating these kinds of integral using a technique called the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview of the problem and the steps</h2>
    <p class="concept">
        We are going to integrate the following function \[e^{-x}sin(x)\]Over the domain \([0,\infty)\). The function can be integrated analytically to give an exact value of \(\frac12\). 
        This will be useful in comparing the results obtained from the two different numerical methods.<br>
        The numerical method will involve selecting a suitable <strong>cut-off</strong> limit, replacing the infinite integral in the limit with the cut-off and approximating the result. Then 
        we will use the <strong>Gauss-Laguerre</strong> quadrature upto two and three points to find approximations to the integral. Finally, we will compare the error estimations for both 
        approaches with the exact result that can be found when integrated analytically.
    </p>
    <h2>Numerical integration techniques</h2>
    <p class="concept">
        To integrate a function \(f(x)\) in the range \([a,b]\), we can consider a sequence of \(n\) points \(a=x_0,x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{n-1},x_n=b\) spaced uniformly \(h\) units in the domain. 
        We then employ one of several numerical integration techniques available to us.
    </p>
    <h3>Trapezoidal rule</h3>
    <p class="concept">
        The trapezoidal rule is the simplest numerical integration method. Starting from the given sequence of points (which are also referred to as <strong>mesh points</strong>), a trapezium 
        is constructred over each interval \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\). The area of all such trapeziums are calculated and summed to give the final approximation. Generally, it has the following formula 
        \[\begin{equation}\int_a^bf(x)dx\approx\dfrac h2\left(f(a)+f(b)+2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(x_i)\right)\end{equation}\]The trapezoidal method works by interpolating a line between each pair of consecutive points, approximating 
        the area under each. Naturally, one would think that a better approximation could be made if instead of interpolating using a line, we intepolated with a polynomial of degree 2. That is 
        what the Simpson's rule does effectively. 
    </p>
    <h3>Simpson's rule</h3>
    <p class="concept">
        As explained above, the Simpson's rule works by interpolating a polynomial of second degree to three consecutive points, then integrates each curve over its own domain to find an approximation 
        to the given curve. It gives rise to the following general formula \[\begin{equation}\int_a^bf(x)dx\approx\dfrac h3\left(f(a)+f(b)+2\sum_{i=\text{even}}f(x_i)+4\sum_{i=\text{odd}}f(x_i)\right)\end{equation}\]
        Where it is to be noted that the distinction for the odd and even points of \(x\) works when the first point is considered the "zeroth-point", that is \(a=x_0\). The formula given above 
        is known more aptly as Simspon's 1/3 rule, after the fact that it has a factor of \(h/3\) in it. We will use this to find an approximate value of the integral.
    </p>

    <h3>Laguerre Polynomial</h3>
    <p class="concept">
        The Laguerre polynomials, \(L_n(x)\) are defined as the solutions to the following differential equation 
        \[\begin{equation}xy''+(1-x)y'+ny=0\end{equation}\]Where the solution would include a non-negative parameter \(n\) 
        that is said to be the order of the polynomial. It is named after French mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Laguerre">Edmond Laguerre</a>.<br>
        To find Laguerre polynomials of an order \(n\), we can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_formula">Rodrigues' formula</a>. 
        The formula is given below \[L_n(x)=\dfrac{e^x}{n!}\dfrac{d^n}{dx^n}\left(e^{-x}x^n\right)\]Using this formula and any CAS 
        (such as this <a href="!link-doesnt-exist">SymPy script I created</a>), we can find any order of Laguerre Polynomials. The first few polyonimals are shown below.

    <h3>Approximation using Laguerre Polynomials</h3>
    <p class="concept">
        It can be shown that a good approximation to the integral 
        can be made using \[\sum_{i=1}^nw_if(x_i)\]given that we find appropriate weights \(w_i\). These weights are found as \[w_i=\dfrac{x_i}{(n+1)^2\left[L_{n+1}(x_i)\right]^2}\]
        Here, \(L_n(x)\) is the \(n\)th order Laguerre polynomial, and \(x_i\) for all \(i=1,2,\cdots,n\) are the roots of the \(L_n(x)\).
